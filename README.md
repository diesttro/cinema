# Cinema

A small movie application made with Next.js using The Movie Database (TMDB) API. It only has a few pages as I only wanted to test the framework's features.

## Usage

Since it's a Next.js project, the following commands can be run: `dev`, `build`, `start`, `lint` and `debug`, the last one is extra for debugging on server-side.

It's important to create the `.env.local` file to store the api key that will be used to get data from TMDB.
